Detailed Report:

**Client Requirements:**

A local small-to mid-size enterprise (SME) would like to have a web page and mobile app developed to advertise their business, receive requests for information from potential customers as well as provide quotes to the potential customers for services requested.
The company’s name is “Empowering the Nation”. This company provides a range of courses to assist domestic workers and gardeners in finding new employment with higher payment.

We need to create the website and mobile app with strong images, fonts and colours to reflect the professional image and purpose of the business, create a logo, allow users to select courses, apply discounts, provide descriptions of courses, calculate fees and provide contact details.

**Solution:**

Create a website and mobile application that appeals to the requirements of the company. There must be simple, but fluid navigation, descriptive text, alluring headings and pictures, selection of courses with discounts, and accurate calculations with contact details in case the user needs help. Flawless calculations and directions are important to provide a user experience that is not frustrating or in some way feels unprofessional.
